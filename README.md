# Hiragana and katakana practice app

A small web app for practicing hiragana and katakana with separate pages for both hiragana and katakana and a page with kana charts. The app shows a random kana and the user has to type it in romaji.
The app shows the amount of correct and incorrect answers and shows the right answer if the user answers incorrectly. Both the submit button and the enter key work for submitting answers.
